# Heart Attack predictor using Streamlit

This is a heart attack predictor which uses a random forrest classifier and gives an accuracy of 82% (I did not focus much on the accuracy as this was to learn Streamit).
I made the model and deployed it as a web app using Streamlit.
The user has to enter the details in the fields and then press predict and the model will tell the Output accordingly.
